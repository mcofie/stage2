# Maxwell Cofie Portfolio

This is a modern, responsive portfolio website adapted from the design aesthetics of [LemFi](https://lemfi.com/en-ca/).

## Features
- **Design**: Clean, minimalist, with bold typography (Space Grotesk) and rounded "pill" shapes.
- **Responsiveness**: Fully responsive layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **Tech Stack**: Pure HTML5 and CSS3. No build steps required.

## Deployment to GitHub Pages

1. **Push to GitHub**:
   Ensure all files (`index.html`, `assets/css/style.css`, `assets/js/main.js`, `README.md`) are committed and pushed to your GitHub repository.

2. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to your repository **Settings**.
   - Navigate to the **Pages** section (on the left sidebar).
   - Under **Build and deployment** > **Source**, select **Deploy from a branch**.
   - Select your main branch (e.g., `main` or `master`) and keeping the folder as `/ (root)`.
   - Click **Save**.

The site will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/` in a few minutes.

## Customization
- **New Projects**: Add new `<article class="project-card">` blocks in `index.html`.
- **Colors**: Edit the CSS variables in `assets/css/style.css` (e.g., `--primary-green`) to change the theme.
